A Sudoku Solver

This is an example of demonstrating how to use ASMIG to solve your sudoku puzzle.
A sudoku puzzle is a NP-complete problem. Thus, solving a sudoku puzzle is just like colouring a petersen graph.

SPECIAL NOTES: The major difficult to work out 'invariant(s)' and formalise them into boolean circuits for any complicated (at least np-complete) puzzles or problems.  For this example, I have already worked out these rules for you, and programmed into Rules.java.  You may change these rules to suit other problems.
In order to solve any sudoku puzzle, you may modify the input to ASMIG by chaning SudokuSolver.java.

Have Fun!!!
