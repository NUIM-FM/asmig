ASMIG (A Small Metamodel Instance Generator)

The current version of asmig is fully open source, purely command-line based.  A GUI for asmig is under development, will be published once it is finsihed.

*Build Instructions for Linux :
1) Make sure you include all the following packages.
	If you don't know how to do so, please see the following example:
		CLASSPATH=:/home/usr1/org.eclipse.emf_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar
		This include eclipse emf jar file when you compiling asmig.  Assume you have org.eclipse.emf_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar under directory of /home/usr
		
2) The complete list are as follows:
			antlr-3.1.3.jar
			org.eclipse.emf.common_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar
			org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar
			org.eclipse.emf.ecore_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar
			org.eclipse.emf.edit_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar
			org.eclipse.emf_2.5.0.v200906151043.jar
			
3) Once you have them all included in your CLASSPATH, you run ant to build asmig.

4) If the build is successful, you may try run some examples from build/classes/examples to make sure asmig is working.
	In order to run these examples, for example, an Sudoku solver, type the following command:
		"java examples.SudokuSolver"
		press any numerical key that is >= 1
		The solution should be printed on the screen.

*Metamodel Instance Generation :
1) A few driven programs have been written inside directory asmig/src/test, to generate metamodel instances you can type the following command:
	Assume you are under the directory of build/classes
	type "java testatg <ecore file> <ocl file>"
	type "java gendia" to produce dot format graphs (Assume you have dot installed on your machine)
	
2) To generate instances that satisfy partition-based criteria
	Assume you are under the directory of build/classes
	type "java testpbf <ecore file>"
	type "java gendia" to produce dot format graphs (Assume you have dot installed on your machine)
	
3) To generate instances that satisfy graph-based criteria:
	Assume you are under the directory of build/classes
	type "java testmetrics <ecore file>"
	type "java gendia" to produce dot format graphs (Assume you have dot installed on your machine)

Currently, asmig dose not provide documentation for API(s), there are quite a lot examples written in both example and test directories.
A proper API documentation is under writing now, it will be aviable online shortly.

Hope you enjoy using asmig to solve your difficult problems.
